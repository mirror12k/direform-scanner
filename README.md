# Direform Toolkit - High-Security Scanning for Terraform Projects

## Overview

Direform Toolkit is a specialized collection of security rules designed to scan Terraform projects, particularly those used in high-security production workloads. This toolkit ensures that your infrastructure as code (IaC) adheres to best practices for security, compliance, and reliability.

The rules within this toolkit are tailored to identify potential security issues, such as misconfigurations, insufficient encryption, and lack of resource logging. By integrating Direform Toolkit into your CI/CD pipeline, you can proactively detect and address security risks during the development process, before they make it into production.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Direform Toolkit, you must have Semgrep installed on your system. Semgrep is a lightweight static analysis tool that is used to perform security scans on your Terraform code. If you don't have Semgrep installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [official Semgrep website](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/).

## Installation

Once you have Semgrep installed, you can clone the Direform Toolkit repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/direform-toolkit.git
cd direform-toolkit
```

## Continuous Integration (CI/CD)

You can easily integrate Direform Toolkit into your CI/CD pipeline by adding the above Semgrep command to your pipeline configuration. This will enable automatic scanning of your Terraform codebase on every build or update, helping you catch security issues early in the development process.

For more advanced CI/CD configurations, refer to the [Semgrep CI documentation](https://semgrep.dev/docs/semgrep-ci/).
